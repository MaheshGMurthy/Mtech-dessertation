This project was created for my dissertation project.
Purpose = Gene expression changes with aging individuals 
Used the gene expression data for tissues like skin, muscle and lungs from the GTEx database
Explanatory data analysis was carried out to visulaise the number to sex, causes of death and age group
UMAP using the umap function to see the dimensionality of the data and groups 
Linear regression was carried out to the segregate the DEGs
Tested for the false positive results using the bonferonni's adjustments 
Used Manhattan plot to see the DEGs
P-values was seen using the histogram
which types of genes was differently expressed was seen in bar graph
GWAS test was carried out to see the DEGs reported in GWAS and not in the database and odds ratio was calculated 
KEGG pathway analysis was carried out to see the top 30 enriched pathways and how they are related to the metabolism related to aging and disease development
